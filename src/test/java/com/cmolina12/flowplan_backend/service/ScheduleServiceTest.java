// ✅ CORE / CRITICAL TEST SCENARIOS

// 1. Multiple courses with one section each (no time overlaps)
//    → Expect 1 valid schedule containing all sections.


// 2. Multiple courses with multiple sections (some overlap, some valid)
//    → Expect only non-overlapping combinations to be returned.


// 3. One course with a valid section, another course with no compatible section
//    → Expect 0 valid schedules due to unavoidable conflicts.


// 4. A course with multiple sections on different days (no overlap)
//    → Expect a valid schedule per section (e.g., 2 sections = 2 schedules).


// ✅ EDGE / STRESS TEST SCENARIOS

// 5. No courses / Empty input
//    → Expect 0 schedules or an empty list.


// 6. Single course with only one section
//    → Expect 1 schedule containing that single section.


// 7. Section with multiple meetings on different days (e.g., Mon & Wed)
//    → All meetings must be considered for overlap validation.


// 8. Sections with same times but on different days (e.g., Mon 9-10 vs Tue 9-10)
//    → Should not conflict and both should be allowed in a schedule.


// 9. Duplicate NRCs or meetings (invalid data or duplicate sections)
//    → Should handle gracefully, depending on your system's behavior (optional: test for exceptions or filter logic).


// ✅ OPTIONAL / REAL-WORLD TEST SCENARIOS

// 10. Stress test with large input: 5+ courses, each with multiple sections
//     → Expect the system to handle exponential combinations correctly and efficiently.


// 11. Back-to-back meetings (end time of one equals start time of another)
//     → Should not count as overlapping (e.g., 10:00–11:00 and 11:00–12:00).


// 12. Sections with null or malformed meeting data
//     → Should raise appropriate exceptions or skip invalid entries (depending on system requirements).
